This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that should report
the client IP address that made the HTTP request. This was confirmed to
work as expected with:

* [x] [Vercel](https://client-report-carloscarnero.vercel.app/),
* [x] Local development environment started with `npm run dev`.

As of this time, only a standalone output environment remains untested.
